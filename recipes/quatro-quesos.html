                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>You thought Dulé Hill couldn't steal the show once again after his residency on the West Wing - well, back by popular demand, he's reprising his role as Burton Guster in the tv-movie revival of Psych this weekend. Revel in the duo's stoner-like propensity for hilariously unhealthy snacks with this week's recreation of a fan favorite: potatoes, stuffed with four cheeses, deep-fried, breaded, and re-fried, nestled on a bed of ancho sour cream and crispy bacon.</p>

                <h2>Method:</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Place the potatoes on a baking sheet, covering them in olive oil and poking them with plenty of holes.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and roast the potatoes until cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Cut the potatoes in half while they are still piping hot and allow the steam to escape for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While they are still warm, run them through a potato ricer on its finest setting.</li>
                    <li>Chop and add the butter so that it melts in the still warm potato.</li>
                    <li>Add a whole egg to the butter and potato.</li>
                    <li>Season liberally with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.</li>
                    <li>Add flour to the mixture if it is too soft to handle.</li>
                    <li>Mix thoroughly and cover with plastic wrap that is right down on the surface of the potatoes.</li>
                    <li>Chill for at least 30 minutes or until firmed up.</li>
                    <li>Cube some sharp cheddar cheese.</li>
                    <li>Wrap the cheese in the potato mixture. Next, coat the potato ball in flour, then dip it in an egg wash, and lastly dip it in bread crumbs. </li>
                    <li>Heat a quart of vegetable oil to 350°F.</li>
                    <li>Fry those guys for 5 to 7 minutes or until browned and crisp.</li>
                    <li>Season generously with kosher salt.</li>
                    <li>Combine some dried ancho chili powder with sour cream.</li>
                    <li>Roast bacon in a 375°F Oven for 20 to 25 minutes until nice and crisp.</li>
                    <li>Put some of the sour cream mixture on a plate, sprinkle with bacon bits and finally the cheese filled potatoes on top.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
