# odin-recipes
In this project, I've created an HTML page that links to three recipe pages.

This project is a part of my The Odin Project journey of their 'Foundations' course. It demonstrates my basic understanding of creating web pages using different HTML elements and tags.

All the recipes have been taken from www.bingingwithbabish.com.
