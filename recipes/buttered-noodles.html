                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This week, we're dipping in the world of Dan Harmon's lovable, irreverent collegiate caricature: Community. I'm here to defend the "weird" favorite food of Abed Nadir: buttered noodles. Yes, that impossibly plain side dish/cafeteria filler/thing you eat when you're sick. With a few simple tricks, we can upgrade this ubiquitous underdog into something worth making all on its own.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1 box high end supermarket pasta</li>
                    <li>Gourmet butter</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt</li>
                    <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>

                <h2>Method:</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Start by bringing an oval-shaped dutch oven of slightly salted water to a boil and then add the high-end pasta. Use slightly less water to make sure the water is extra starchy.</li>
                    <li>Once the pasta is done, put aside about ½ cup of the water and then drain the pasta. Return it to the warm pot and do not rinse.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 tablespoons of the unsalted gourmet butter,  ¼ cup of the pasta water, and a generous pinch of kosher salt.</li>
                    <li>Give it all a rigorous stir until everything is completely dissolved and mixed together.</li>
                </ol>
