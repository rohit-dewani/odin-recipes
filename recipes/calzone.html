    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Ben Wyatt: mayor of Ice Town, occasional Batman impersonator, and unwavering disciple of the calzone. Today we celebrate Ben's fandom with a trio of his most notorious pizza pocket projects: calzone-shaped apple pie, (poisonous) mini calzones, and the low-cal-calzone-zone. Pizza is better as a sandwich, isn't it?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>8 ¼ oz whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>5 ½ oz bread flour</li>
        <li>¾ tsp instant yeast</li>
        <li>2 tsp honey</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cup ice water</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Broccoli, chopped</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Red Peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Baby spinach</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Baby batchoy </li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Mustard greens</li>
        <li>Part-skim mozzarella</li>
        <li>Part-skim ricotta </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Start by combining 8 ¼ oz of whole wheat flour with 5 ½ oz of bread flour then adding ¾ teaspoon of instant yeast and 2 teaspoons of honey in the bowl of a food processor. Lightly process together until they are thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>To knead the dough in the processor, measure out and pour 1 ¼ cup of ice water into the processor's feed tube while the machine runs and forms the dough into a ball. Stop the processor and let everything rest for 10 minutes to help with water absorption.</li>
        <li>Then add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 ½ teaspoon of kosher salt and let the food processor run for 1 minute straight kneading the dough.</li>
        <li>With this dough being extremely sticky, on a well-oiled surface and oiled hands turn out the dough and give a few cursory knead to make sure of no dry spots. Then using the dough's stickiness to pull it into a taut ball then place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow to ferment in the fridge for at least 18 hours and up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>After a few days in the fridge, remove from the plastic wrap and divide into two pieces and stretch into taut balls, place on a well oiled rimmed baking sheet, lightly oil the two pieces of dough and loosely cover it in plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 1 ½ hour (90 minutes).</li>
        <li>In a separate pie pan filled with a little all-purpose flour, place each dough (separately) into the pan and cover generously on both sides with all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Once covered, on a well-floured surface pat and stretch using the knuckle over knuckle method until it reaches 12” round. At which point is ready for toppings.</li>
        <li>In a nonstick saute pan, saute 1 tablespoon of broccoli in some olive oil then add 1 tablespoon of red peppers, baby spinach, baby batchoy, and mustard greens until nicely wilted and cooked.</li>
        <li>On the dough, place 6-7 pieces of part-skim mozzarella, a few toppings of part-skim ricotta, and the sauteed vegetables followed by another layer of part-skim mozzarella and ricotta.</li>
        <li>Brush the outer rim of the dough with plain water and fold the opposite over crimping the edges using a fork then a preventative measure of blowouts give the edges a decorative fold.</li>
        <li>Place on a lightly floured, dusted pizza peel then onto a pizza stone in a preheated 550°F oven where it will be plopped while emerging burnished and brown and done. Let sit undisturbed for 5 minutes to let the fillings cool down.</li>
        <li>Cut into equal pieces and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
